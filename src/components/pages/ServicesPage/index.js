      Quality of advice is paramount, but so is service. Service means establishing at the

      each client is kept fully informed of developments with regular updates.
      The firm establishes relationships with its clients which extend beyond the
      provisions of his legal services. The firms clients consider them to be a personal
      friend and advisor.
